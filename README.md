# ShootTheMummies!
 A simple 3D FPS game 

 # IMPORTANT! How to play:
 - WASD for movement
 - SPACE for jump/double jump
 - Swap weapons using mouse scrollwheel or number keys
 - Shoot using left mouse button (gun will auto-reload for you!)
 - Don't die and defeat the mummies!
 
 ## About
 My very first project that got me in-depth into the aspects of 3D games. It was difficult, yet very rewarding

 ## Objective of project
 - A 3D game that has basic movement and weapon mechanics
 - Get a feel for how the Unity engine works
 
 ## Known bugs
 - When player lands on a surface that is horizontal, player is not able to jump and instead has to fall onto the floor to jump again
